# Pneumonia-detection
A Deep learning model is developed that is capable of predicting if a person has pneumonia or he/she is normal based on input X-Ray images of patient's lungs.

The model is trained with a custom made Convolutional neural Network with optimized Hyperparamters.The accuracy of this developed model is 91.5%.

NOTE - The training images datase used are from kaggle.com
URL for dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

It consists of training , validation and test image sets.
